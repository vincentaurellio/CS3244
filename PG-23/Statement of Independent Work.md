## 2. References. 

We give credit where credit is due. We acknowledge that we used the following websites or contacts to complete this assignment:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/imdb-spoiler-dataset, for the Datasets

https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training, for BERT model (that was not submitted due to high time complexity to run on CPU that causes insufficient time for debugging)

https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html, for lemmatization

ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/), when unsure of what causes the unexpected change in results/errors etc. (eg. lemmatization giving worst performance at some instances) (eg. BERT model taking 48 hours to train) (eg. unable to install sklearnex but was not given an answer to why it happens and how to fix)

https://medium.com/intel-analytics-software/from-hours-to-minutes-600x-faster-svm-647f904c31ae, learned about patch_sklearn() to improve training time of SVM

https://norma.ncirl.ie/4318/1/anyelolindo.pdf, for significance of spoiler detection

CS3244 lecture slides, referred to most of the lectures for concept and library/methods/models to consider
